## Overview

This is an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to select between the three classic options: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The computer (bot) will also make a random selection each round. The game then determines the winner and displays the current scores and the overall winner on the webpage.

## How to Play

**1] User Selection:** The user clicks on one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

**2] Bot Selection:** The bot randomly selects one of the three options.

**3] Determining the Winner:** The game logic compares the user’s choice with the bot’s choice to determine the winner of the round:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock

**4] Updating Scores:** The scores are updated based on the outcome of the round:
  - If the user wins, the user's score increases.
  - If the bot wins, the bot's score increases.
  - If it's a tie, no score is added.

**5] Displaying Results:** The current scores and the winner of each round are displayed on the webpage.

## Technical Details

- **HTML:** Structures the layout of the game, including buttons for user selection and areas to display scores and results.

- **CSS:** Styles the game, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **JavaScript:** Contains the game logic, handles user interactions, and updates the DOM to display results and scores.
